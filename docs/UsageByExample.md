The following pages illustrate how bluash could be used for various shell scripting tasks (once it is implemented!):

* [basics](String-Templating--Detailed-Design): use command line arguments given to script, call "sub procedures", branch on conditions
* [string ops](Usage-Examples%3A-Strings-Ops): combine character strings and numbers into other strings
* [iterations](Usage-Examples-_-Iteration-Looping): loop over lists of files, extension types, folders, etc
* [env vars](http://github.com/schollii/bluash/wiki/Usage-Examples:-Environment-Vars): read and write environment variables
* [filesystem](http://github.com/schollii/bluash/wiki/Usage-Examples:-File-System): various filesystem operations like copy or move files, list files in a folder, walk filesystem, find all files that satisfy some condition on filename or content, etc
* [OS commands](http://github.com/schollii/bluash/wiki/Usage-Examples:-OS-Commands): start and stop processes, branch based on exit code of process
* [Piping](http://github.com/schollii/bluash/wiki/Usage-Examples:-Piping): capture and parse their output, send them input created in script
