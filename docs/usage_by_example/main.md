The following pages illustrate how bluash could be used for various shell scripting tasks (once it is implemented!):

* [Basics](basics.md): use command line arguments given to script, call "sub procedures", branch on conditions
* [String ops](string_ops.md): combine character strings and numbers into other strings
* [Iterations](iterations.md): loop over lists of files, extension types, folders, etc
* [Env vars](env_vars.md): read and write environment variables
* [Filesystem](file_system.md): various filesystem operations like copy or move files, list files in a folder, 
  walk filesystem, find all files that satisfy some condition on filename or content, etc
* [OS commands](os_commands.md): start and stop processes, branch based on exit code of process
* [Piping](piping.md): capture and parse their output, send them input created in script
